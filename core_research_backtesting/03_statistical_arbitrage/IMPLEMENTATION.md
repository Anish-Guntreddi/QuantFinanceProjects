- **Signal Generation**: Z-score based entry/exit with multiple filters
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive backtesting and analysis tools

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Example Analysis

```bash
python example_analysis.py
```

This will run a complete demonstration showing:
- Cointegrated pair detection
- Spread construction with multiple methods
- OU process parameter estimation  
- Signal generation and backtesting
- Performance analysis and visualization

### 3. Run Full Backtest

```bash
python run_statarb_backtest.py --config configs/strategy_config.yml
```

This runs the complete backtesting pipeline with:
- Multi-pair portfolio construction
- Dynamic hedge ratio estimation
- Regime-aware signal filtering
- Risk parity position sizing
- Comprehensive performance reporting

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
python tests/test_basic.py
```

## Key Components

### Cointegration Testing (`signals/cointegration/`)
- **EngleGrangerTest**: Two-step cointegration test with diagnostics
- **JohansenTest**: Multivariate cointegration with multiple vectors
- **PhillipsOuliarisTest**: Robust test for structural breaks
- **PairFinder**: Automated pair discovery with quality scoring

### Spread Construction (`signals/spread/`)
- **SpreadConstructor**: Multiple construction methods (OLS, TLS, Kalman, PCA)
- **OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess**: Complete OU process modeling with simulation
- **HalfLifeCalculator**: Multiple half-life estimation methods
- **ZScoreCalculator**: Robust z-score calculation with multiple methods

### Dynamic Hedging (`signals/hedging/`)
- **KalmanHedgeRatio**: Kalman filter for time-varying hedge ratios
- **OLSHedgeRatio**: Static hedge ratios with comprehensive diagnostics
- **RollingHedgeRatio**: Time-varying ratios with multiple window methods
- **DynamicHedgeOptimizer**: Portfolio-level hedge optimization

### Risk Management (`risk/`)
- **RiskParityOptimizer**: True risk parity with convex optimization
- **PortfolioRiskManager**: Comprehensive risk monitoring
- **ConcentrationLimits**: Position and sector concentration controls
- **DrawdownController**: Dynamic risk adjustment based on drawdowns

## Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files for all parameters:

### Strategy Configuration (`configs/strategy_config.yml`)
- Data sources and date ranges
- Pair selection criteria
- Signal generation parameters
- Risk management settings
- Execution parameters

### Universe Configuration (`configs/universe.yml`)
- Asset universe definition
- Asset classifications
- Pair restrictions and preferences
- Risk overlays and limits

## Data Requirements

The system can work with multiple data sources:

1. **Yahoo Finance**: Automatic data download using yfinance
2. **CSV Files**: Local data files in standard format
3. **Sample Data**: Generated cointegrated data for testing

Minimum requirements:
- 2+ years of daily data
- Properly aligned timestamps
- Clean, adjusted prices

## Performance Characteristics

Based on backtesting with the included example:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Typically 1.5-2.5 for well-selected pairs
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Usually 5-15% with proper risk management
- **Win Rate**: Generally 55-65% with mean-reverting strategies
- **Capacity**: Scalable to 10-100+ pair portfolios

## Extensions and Customization

The framework is designed for easy extension:

### Adding New Cointegration Tests
```python
class MyCointegrationTest:
    def test(self, y1, y2):
        # Your test logic
        return is_cointegrated, p_value, details
```

### Custom Spread Construction
```python
class MySpreadConstructor:
    def construct_spread(self, data, **kwargs):
        # Your spread construction logic
        return spread_result
```

### Alternative Signal Generation
```python
class MySignalGenerator:
    def generate_signals(self, spread, zscore):
        # Your signal logic
        return signals_df
```

## Best Practices

### Data Handling
- Always use properly adjusted prices
- Handle corporate actions (splits, dividends)
- Validate data quality before analysis
- Use sufficient historical data (2+ years)

### Parameter Selection
- Use in-sample data for parameter estimation
- Validate on out-of-sample data
- Consider walk-forward analysis
- Monitor parameter stability

### Risk Management
- Implement position limits early
- Use portfolio-level risk controls
- Monitor correlation regimes
- Have circuit breakers for extreme losses

### Production Deployment
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Use proper error handling
- Consider latency requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Data Issues**: Check data quality and alignment
3. **Optimization Failures**: Try different solvers or fallback methods
4. **Performance Issues**: Use vectorized operations and proper indexing

### Debug Mode
Set logging level to DEBUG in configuration for detailed output.
